# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on the Titanic dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualizations)

## Project Overview
In this project, we will:
1. Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the features and data quality.
2. Clean the data and perform feature engineering.
3. Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict survival.
4. Evaluate model performance.
